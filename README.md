## Model Accuracy

Our TensorFlow model, which uses a CNN for image classification, currently has an accuracy of around 71%. This accuracy can be significantly improved with more training time.

## Data Source

We obtained our data from this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yuzhenlu/cottonweedid15).

## Tools Used

We used AI to help with frontend and backend. We used a youtube tutorial by SPOTLESS TECH to help with the image classification model.
